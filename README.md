# Making a Weather Dashboard

This project used the OpenWeatherMap API to bring weather information into a single, well-designed dashboard.

The OpenWeatherMap API is easy to use and the organization of the JSON response is really well done. Finding all of the data points I wanted for the dashboard didn't take as long as I thought!

The trickiest part of the project was getting the past search buttons to bring up that cities information. I ended up dynamically creating the buttons through Javascript and then creating a click event inside the function that referred back to those buttons.

I like the minimalist styling of the dashboard itself and the simple view of the information. I decided to hide the entire dashboard until after the user types in their first search because it makes the first look cleaner and more streamlined.
